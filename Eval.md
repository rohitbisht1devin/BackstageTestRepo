# Evaluation Guide

## Introduction

This guide is intended to help you evaluate the quality of a machine learning model. It is important to evaluate the model to ensure that it is performing as expected and to identify any potential issues. This guide will cover the following topics:

- [Evaluation Metrics](#evaluation-metrics)
- [Cross-Validation](#cross-validation)
- [Hyperparameter Tuning](#hyperparameter-tuning)
- [Model Interpretability](#model-interpretability)
- [Model Robustness](#model-robustness)
- [Model Fairness](#model-fairness)
- [Model Bias](#model-bias)
- [Model Variance](#model-variance)
- [Model Complexity](#model-complexity)
